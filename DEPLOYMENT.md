# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## ✅ All Changes Pushed Successfully!

Your project is now ready for Vercel deployment. All configurations have been set up correctly.

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

### Method 1: Using Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
4. Select your repository: `tanishbala-thecursorguy/Shuziren-AI`
5. Vercel will auto-detect the settings:
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
   - **Install Command:** `npm install`
6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

### Method 2: Using Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Added `vercel.json` for proper SPA routing
2. ✅ Changed build output from `build` to `dist` in `vite.config.ts`
3. ✅ Verified build works correctly (all assets bundled)
4. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build files
5. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub

## 📝 Important Notes

- The build was tested locally and works perfectly
- All Figma assets are properly aliased
- SPA routing is configured (all routes point to index.html)
- Build size: ~482KB JavaScript + ~43KB CSS

## 🌐 After Deployment

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
- Primary URL: `https://shuziren-ai.vercel.app` (or similar)
- You can add a custom domain in Vercel dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Ensure Node version is 18+ (set in Vercel project settings)
3. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
4. Contact Vercel support if needed
